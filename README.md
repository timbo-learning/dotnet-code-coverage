#### SonarQube, getting it to work

https://www.sonarqube.org/

Using Travis-CI integration

1. Set up Travis-ci.
[C# Project](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/csharp/) |
[Custom Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/)
1. Travis-CI does not support dotnet 2.2 yet. Downgraded to 2.1.
2. Following sonarqube instructions.
[SonarCloud + Travis](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/sonarcloud/)
3. Generated a Token for the app and included `SONAR_TOKEN` on Travis Settings_
4. Changed some configuration on sonarcloud under `Administration>General Settings`, such as Test files and source files.
5. Add configuration to sonar-project.properties

#### Report Generator 

Generates a very descriptive `index.htm` under `Calculation.Tests/report-generator-coverage`,
showing line coverage, branch coverage, covered lines, build history.

! Cannot see line coverage of past builds

on this project under `core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-dotnet-test`, run:

```
python3 coverlet.py
cd Calculation.Tests
python3 report-generator.py
```

You can click on a class to see its details:

And it shows line coverage (as shown before on Visual Studio Code).

Next steps are trying Grafana or SonarQube.
#### Report Generator, getting it to work

[Usage instructions](https://danielpalme.github.io/ReportGenerator/usage.html) (generates the cli command)

``` bash
dotnet add package ReportGenerator
```

Make sure to include reportgenerator in your `.csproj`:

    <ItemGroup>
        <DotNetCliToolReference Include="dotnet-reportgenerator-cli" Version="4.0.4" />
      </ItemGroup>

In this case, I used the `Calculation.Tests.csproj` to produce the report for both projects (Calculation and PrimeService).
Apparently ReportGenerator just needs the xml files generated by `coverlet`.

#### Graphic Reports options

Following https://medium.com/agilix/collecting-test-coverage-using-coverlet-and-sonarqube-for-a-net-core-project-ef4a507d4b28

Good Candidates:

0. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
1. [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) (comes in form of a Docker Image also) (can plugin from github).
    SonarQube seems to be microservices centered because
    it launches a web server and sits behind a HTTP API.
2. [ReportGenerator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReportGenerator/4.0.4)

## Integrating with Visual Studio

For graphical display, I'm looking for a integration with visual studio,

Following
https://www.hanselman.com/blog/NETCoreCodeCoverageAsAGlobalToolWithCoverlet.aspx

https://dotnetthoughts.net/code-coverage-in-netcore-with-coverlet/
also seems useful

Tried installing [Coverage Gutters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters&WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha),
Tried renaming .vsix to .zip, extracting and tinkering with extension.vsixmanifest and back, did not work.

Failed on Visual Studio Professional 2017.
Works on Visual Studio **Code**.

![Coverage-Gutter](screenshots/vs-code-coverage-gutters.png)

[codecover](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradleymeck.codecover) as a second option to Coverage Gutters perhaps


[dotCover](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JetBrains.dotCover) also seems to be a solution that does not use coverlet, but it is paid.


## Coverlet First run


``` bash
mkdir coverlet-output
coverlet.exe PrimeService.Tests/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.2/PrimeService.Tests.dll --target dotnet --targetargs "test PrimeService.Tests --no-build" -o coverlet-output/
```

# Original README.MD

# Unit testing using dotnet test sample

This sample is part of the [unit testing tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test) for creating applications with unit tests included. See that topic for detailed steps on the code for this sample.

## Key features

This sample demonstrates creating a library and writing effective unit tests that validate the features in that library. The example provides a service that indicates whether a number is prime.

## Restore and test

To run the tests, navigate to the *PrimeService.Tests* directory and type the following commands:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet test
```

`dotnet restore` restores the packages of both projects.
`dotnet test` builds both projects and runs all of the configured tests.
